                    will alert that conditions may not be ideal for a certain

                    ballot with the same identity, followed by a simulated
                    in-person pollbook vote for the same voter. Introduce a
                    short simulated network partition and recovery while these
                    attempts occur. Confirm that all subsequent attempts are
                    rejected and that voter status remains synchronized and
                    consistent across systems after connectivity is
                    restored.</span
